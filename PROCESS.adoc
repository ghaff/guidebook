= The Open Source Way Publishing Process 

The workflow of The Open Source Way is largely dependent on the functionality of the GitHub platform. GitHub is a web-based distributed version control tool that enables content creators build and collaborate on text-based creations (code, prose) wherever they can connect to the Internet.

The Open Source Way process will be divided into two distinct parts: contribution and editorial.

Contribution is the process of initial creation; it will take full advantage of GitHub's distributed features, adding  content to GitHub in a separate branch, and then merging into the main content of The Open Source Way.

Editorial is the process or perfecting the created content, via various editing passes. This can be done primarily within GitHub's issue-tracking tools, within the GitHub interface. 

Before beginning work on The Open Source Way, it is important for all participants to have a https://github.com/[GitHub account] if they don't have already. All work done on The Open Source Way will be done within the https://github.com/theopensourceway/guidebook[guidebook repository] of the https://github.com/theopensourceway[The Open Source Way organization].
